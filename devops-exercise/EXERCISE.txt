Exercise: errchecker

During the exercise, we expect the candidate to have a NOTES.TXT file created where the candidate writes relevant notes for this exercise. The notes can be anything ranging from decisions the candidate took due to imprecisions on the exercise description, smart improvements worth highlighting, or (optionally) parts that could not be completed or were done partially and an explanation on the reason. 

Part 1: Error checking
We need a bash/python script (the candidate can choose which language to use) that checks exceptions in the logs during the startup of tomcat applications. We will call this script "errchecker".
For this exercise we will assume that the tomcat application will store its startup logs (logs can have any name, and can be many logs) under /tmp/tomcat-logs/
"errchecker" will be running permanently in the server, even before the Tomcat application is there, so it must be pretty flexible handling errors, and should be able to detect the creation of new files on the fly.
"errchecker" must be constantly checking /tmp/tomcat-logs/ for new lines in logs files, and write the ones that contain the word "Exception:" or "ERROR" to /tmp/errchecker-log.txt . When it detects tomcat startup line ( "INFO: Server startup in:" ), it must write "TOMCAT IS STARTED" into /tmp/errchecker-log.txt, the number of exceptions detected during the startup, reset its exceptions counter, and continue running.
If /tmp/errchecker-log.txt already exists, it should append its output. Do not overwrite/delete it.

Part 2: Maven packaging

After the part above is completed, you will have to package the script and the notes using Maven 3.
Put your files in the following structure in the filesystem:
mysource/src/main/resources/scripts/errchecker
mysource/src/main/resources/docs/NOTES.txt

And then create a pom.xml file at: mysource/pom.xml

Please, write the proper pom.xml and any other files you consider relevant so when ‘mvn package’ is run a .tar.gz with the following structure is generated:

project/bin/errchecker (with executable permissions)
project/docs/NOTES.txt

It does not matter if the .tar.gz gets additional files as long as the two stated above are in those locations.
When running ‘mvn package’ a .jar file should NOT be generated.

How to submit
To submit the exercise, please send back an e-mail to the recruiter with the following attachments:

1. Your source code (mysource directory) compressed in a .tar.gz (make sure NOTES.TXT is included on it)
2. The .tar.gz file generated by maven
3. Any other files you may consider relevant (settings.xml if you used it, etc.)
