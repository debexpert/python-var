My more or less useful Python stuff
=========================================
This repository is to store all my Python stuff in one place. look at it, use it, fork it, laugh at it,
if you think it is useful use it, if you think it is crap improve it, comment on it, do whatever you like 
with it, but whatever you do, make it public and share it back for everyone to enjoy the same way as you did.
